# Quality Control of daily GPS data from station KLOK

NOA operates Klokotos GNSS station in Thessaly. In this report, we create an automated modular procedure of downloading Klokotos' data from the beginning of its operation until present day, performing quality control on the data and plotting the calculated values of the quality parameters (Multipath and SNR) over this period.
